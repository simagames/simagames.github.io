          <h2>Seasons</h2>
          <p>
            If you already play other ARPGs, you should be familiar with the concept of seasons (some games also call it ladder or cycle). 
            Otherwise, here's a rough introduction: There's a new season every few months. Heroes that are created during a season usually 
            receive some sort of temporary bonus and are allowed to compete for spots on a seasonal leaderboard. Some games also have 
            thematic features that are only active during one season.
          </p>
          <p>
            In ZpellCatz we will have seasonal tasks, a season tree and a leaderboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Newly created seasonal heroes can complete seasonal tasks. As a reward, they receive points for their season tree.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            The points can be used to unlock bonuses. There are three branches: More loot, additional stats and minimap compass.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Seasonal heroes also take part in the competition for the leaderboard. The score for this increases through all kind of 
            activities, for example by completing seasonal tasks. Roughly speaking, the more you play your seasonal hero, the higher 
            your score.

          <h2>Late Game Changes</h2>
          <p>
            Season 1 will be released together with version 1.4. In addition to the usual bug fixes and balance changes, the new version 
            also offers major changes to the late game (only affects heroes with level 45 and above).
          </p>
          <p>
            My feeling, which has been reinforced by player feedback, is that leveling feels a bit tough from the Intermediate Realm onwards. 
            Leveling up from level 45 takes a long time, which is a shame because it's fun to further expand your skill tree(s). For this reason, 
            the maximum level was increased from 60 to 100. The enemy levels of Intermediate Realm dungeons and the experience curve has been 
            adjusted accordingly. You will now level up much more frequently on your journey through the Intermediate Realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, a new Seer skill tree will be introduced in the upcoming version. This tree is available to every class combination and is 
            unlocked at level 45. The Seer tree offers very strong bonuses and always has new skills for heroes on their way to the outer edges 
            of the Intermediate Realm.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the position of two Uber Bosses has been moved to earlier areas in the Intermediate Realm. This change allows players 
            to enjoy an interesting challenge sooner, even if they haven't revealed the entire intermediate realm map. The level and difficulty 
            have been adjusted accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Note: The late game changes in version 1.4 are available to all heroes. For non-seasonal heroes of level 50 and above, the transition 
            may not be entirely smooth, as enemies in the middle to later areas of the Intermediate Realm will be much higher level than your 
            version 1.3 heroes. One idea would be to respec your skills (this will be cheaper in 1.4) and invest heavily in the Seer tree to increase 
            your chances against high-level opponents. In general, my recommendation is a new start with a seasonal hero.
