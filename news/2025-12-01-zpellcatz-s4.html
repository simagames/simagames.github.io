          <h2>Season 4: Gift of the Jeweler</h2>
          <p>
            Season 4 will be all about gems and their casket. The following bonuses will be active during the next season:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>During season 4, gems can be found not only from bosses, but also in treasure rooms.</li>
            <li>The chance to find rare gems is greatly increased.</li>
            <li>Bosses drop additional dust (scales with dungeon level).</li>
            <li>Unsocketing gems is a lot cheaper.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As in the last season, the overall difficulty is lower due to the strong bonuses. But it's fun to find items 
            (or gems in this season) that you've never seen in many previous runs. Along with the season, a new version 
            will also be released that enhances some gems.
          </p>
