            Hey there, fellow Catz! A new version of ZpellCatz is available now.

          <h2>Aim Assistant</h2>
          <p>
            It's sometimes hard to hit enemies with skills like 'Ice Missiles' or 'Fire Ball' in the recently released version 1.0.0. This update 
            simplifies the aim assistant options menu. Also, skills that had trouble hitting enemies now have a minor shot pursuit effect when the 
            aim assistant is activated. Finally, there was a bug that the aim assistant wasn't working for Familiars controlled by a player. This 
            issue has been fixed!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Shrine of Revival</h2>
          <p>
            ZpellCatz was never designed to be a super hard souls-like game. I got feedback that the difficulty on normal / normal was way too high 
            and that it's frustrating to re-run the whole dungeon when you die during a boss fight. That's why I developed a cool new feature: 
            Shrines of Revival!
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="/games/zpellcatz-assets/dd/update-1.1.0/shrine.jpg" class="img_680">
          </p>
          <p>
            The room directly in front of a boss now always contains a Shrine of Revival. If you die in a dungeon and have already discovered the 
            shrine room, you will be revived there <b>once</b> (including Familiars and potion refill). Note that shrines are only activated on 
            normal / normal. No shrines for you in 'Challenging' difficulty, 'Hardcore' or 'Cat-core'.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Familiars and Local Multiplayer</h2>
          <p>
            The changes to the aim assistant and some small bonuses for Familiars help to make you feel less like a sitekick as a second player. 
            Feel free to try it out. As a release party event, I spent several hours in local multiplayer mode with my friends and we tweaked the 
            values ​​until it felt good. Personal tip: Choose Loki if the Familiar is played by another player.
          </p>
