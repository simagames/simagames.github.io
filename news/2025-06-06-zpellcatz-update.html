            Hey there, fellow Catz! One year ago, ZpellCatz was released - happy birthday! Let's celebrate together with version 1.5 
            and the start of a new season.
          </p>

          <h2>Experimental: Time Distortion</h2>
          <p>
            Compared to other (modern) ARPGs, it's noticeable that ZpellCatz plays a bit slower. That's generally okay, but I 
            want to start a test in version 1.5 to see if a speed boost would benefit the game. Therefore, the general pace has been increased quite 
            significantly for this version (and this season). Feel free to try it out and please let me know what you think of the change. 
            Should we keep the new game speed or revert back to the original after the season?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Less Grind, More Variety</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy unlocking new dungeons and bonuses in the Intermediate Realm. However, it sometimes feels very grindy to fight the same enemies 
            and bosses over and over again before you're "allowed" to move on to the next dungeon. For this reason, there are several small adjustments 
            intended to further improve the end game of ZpellCatz.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, enemies, their mods, and bosses are rerolled after each successful Intermediate Realm dungeon (so after each boss kill). 
            This makes each new run feel fresh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the size of the Intermediate Realm dungeons has been reduced, and the required clears for the third bonus have been reduced 
            from 7 to 5. These changes allow you to move from one dungeon to the next much more smoothly. The experience curve has been adjusted so 
            that even with the new values, you'll always have the appropriate level for the corresponding dungeons.
          </p>
