            Happy new year, fellow Catz! 2024 starts with a lot of new features for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1447700/ZpellCatz/">ZpellCatz</a>: 
            Highscore, (shared) stash, new game modes and lots of minor changes. In addition, the demo / prologue has been updated so that Familiars and 
            local multiplayer are now available there. 
            As with any new beta version, more players are invited. So, check your e-mails / Steam client if you've registered for access.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>New Features</h2>
          <p>
            A stash has been added to the Market Hall. It has 6 pages, 2 personal ones (per cat hero) and 4 shared ones. The shared pages are, well, shared amongst 
            all heroes, allowing you to give items from one cat to another. Each page has 30 item slots, so you now have enough space to store every 
            <a href="https://www.simagames.com/games/zpellcatz-assets/epics-t1.html">tier 1</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.simagames.com/games/zpellcatz-assets/epics-t2.html">tier 2 epic item</a> (if you want to do that for whatever reason :-D ).
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="/games/zpellcatz-assets/dd/update-0.100.0/1-shared-stash.jpg" class="img_680">
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the features that I always enjoyed while playing Legends of Pixelia is now also available in ZpellCatz: Highscores! The score is calculated the 
            moment you defeat a boss and there is a distinct highscore table per dungeon. Only dungeons with a boss room have a highscore table.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's also a <a href="/games/zpellcatz-assets/highscore.html">web version of the highscore table</a> available here if you want to share 
            your excellent score with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="/games/zpellcatz-assets/dd/update-0.100.0/2-highscore.jpg" class="img_680">
          </p>
          <p>
            Up for a challenge? There are new game modes available that increase the difficulty of ZpellCatz. Game modes can be selected when creating a cat hero 
            and they are permanent. You get a small bonus to your dungeon score for beating a boss with active game modes selected.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hardcore: Your typical permadeath option as you know it from every other ARPG</li>
            <li>Cat-core: Similar to hardcore, but you have 7 lives instead of 1</li>
            <li>Challenging: Enemies have greatly increased stats, designed for players that love to grind</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Do cats have 7 lives or 9 lives? This varies from country to country. In the culture I grew up in, cats have 7 lives. And since 7 is a wonderful 
            number, we'll take that. :-) 
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Familiars and local multiplayer are coming to the demo / prologue. So if you don't have beta access (yet), feel free to toy around with Familiars 
            in Autuna.
          </p>
