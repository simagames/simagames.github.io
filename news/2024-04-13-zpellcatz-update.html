            Hey there, fellow Catz! A new version of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1447700/ZpellCatz/">ZpellCatz</a> closed beta
            is available now. This version features a UI overhaul, a new tailor NPC and lots of balance changes.
            As with any new beta version, more players are invited. So, check your e-mails / Steam client if you've registered for access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, there'll be an <b>exciting announcement regarding ZpellCatz</b> next week. Stay tuned!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>New Features</h2>
          <p>
            The UI and especially the menus needed some polish. Nearly every UI screen has been updated in this version and I really like the new style. 
            Have a look at the updated skill and inventory screens:

          <p>
            A new NPC joined the Greencat Village: Halge, the tailor. Halge offers a service to change the appearance of cat heroes. 
            And the best part? The service is free of charge! So change your look as often as you want to.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            This version also feature a ton of balance changes. As I've added more and more late game content over the last few weeks, 
            it's become increasingly clear which classes were significantly stronger than others. After this round of balance changes, the power 
            levels of each class should be in the same ball park.
          </p>
