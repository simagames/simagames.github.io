            Hey there, fellow Catz! A new version of ZpellCatz is available now.

          <h2>Intermediate Realm Rewards</h2>
          <p>
            I really like the Intermediate Realm in ZpellCatz. It's intended to be a fun grind experience, but it turned out a little 
            bit too grindy in version 1.1.0 of ZpellCatz. That's why the third tier of rewards was changed from 10 dungeon clears to 
            7 dungeon clears. Since players now do fewer runs per Intermediate Realm dungeon and thus find fewer items and statues before entering 
            the next more powerful ones, some clear rewards have been increased to compensate.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Tier 3 Epic Smart Drops</h2>
          <p>
            My level 51 Forest Shaman has found 9 copies of 'Guardian of Aeons' but didn't find a single 'Sapphire Rod' or 'Tundra Walker' yet. Random 
            drops are part of every ARPG, but it feels a little bit frustrating to keep finding the same tier 3 epic items over and over again. To fix 
            this, the tier 3 epic item smart drop system has been reworked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every hero class, path class and combination has "favorite" tier 3 epic items. In version 1.1.0, every tier 3 epic item drop had a high 
            chance to be a random one (weighted) from the list of favorites. Since every drop was a new RNG roll, situations as described above were 
            pretty common (finding the same items over and over again). The change in version 1.2.0 intruduces a new system that works like a stack 
            of cards (under the hood, you don't see cards anywhere). The stack contains cards for every 
            favorite item as well as "random item" cards and is shuffled. When a tier 3 epic item drops, we draw a card from the stack to determine 
            the tier 3 epic item type. When the stack is empty, we rebuild and shuffle it. This way, you are guaranteed to find every favorite item 
            of your class combination at some point.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Early Epic Items</h2>
          <p>
            You're not in the late game yet and want to know what patch 1.2.0 brings for you? Lots of tier 1 and tier 2 epic items have been buffed. 
            The focus was on items that were either intended for a specific class combination or items that just seemed a bit too boring. Enjoy!
          </p>
