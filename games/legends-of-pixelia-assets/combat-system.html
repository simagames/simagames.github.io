            It is not easy to master the combat system in Legends of Pixelia, but this page will help by giving some info about the mechanics behind it. :-)

          <h2 id="basic">Basic Combo</h2>
          <p>
            An essential way to win a fight in Legends of Pixelia is doing combos. The easiest way to start learning combos is doing the basic combo: 
            <span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span> (or press and hold <span class="_a">(A)</span> for a short time).
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="box_row">
        <div class="box_content">
          The basic combo can be executed by every hero class, but the result is slightly different.
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="flinch">Flinching</h2>
          <p>
            Flinching is the short "ouch, I have been hit!" animation that immediately starts when a player or an enemy has been hit by a normal attack. 
            The default flinch duration is about half a second, whereas some skills have a longer flinch time (e.g. Paladin's <span class="_x">Force Nova</span>) 
            or no flinching at all (e.g. Vamp Hunter's <span class="_y">Orbit Shield</span>).
          </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="box_row">
        <div class="box_content">
          Whenever you are able to hit an enemy again while it is flinching, we're talking about a flinch combo. Some easy to do flinch combos are:
          <ul>
            <li>Knight, use <span class="_b">Sword Blast (B)</span>, then immediately <span class="_y">Shield Dash (Y)</span></li>
            <li>Paladin, simply use your <span class="_y">Holy Cross (Y)</span> skill and watch...</li>
          </ul>
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="air">Air</h2>
          <p>
            Some attacks have the ability to throw an enemy up in the air (e.g. Paladin's <span class="_b">Spirit</span>). Whenever you are able to hit 
            an enemy again while it is in the air, we're talking about an air combo. One word of caution here: You can't hit enemies that are too high in the air, 
            so time your air combos well. Some skills that throw enemies very high are e.g. Knight's <span class="_x">Sky Slash</span> or 
            Barbarian's <span class="_x">Shockwave</span>.
          </p>

        <div class="box_content">
          Some easy to do air combos are:
          <ul>
            <li>Barbarian, first do your basic combo (<span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span>), then immediately use <span class="_y">Whirlwind (Y)</span></li>
            <li>Knight, first do your basic combo (<span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span>), then immediately use <span class="_b">Sword Blast (B)</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="ground">Ground</h2>
          <p>
            When a character that has been thrown into the air lands, it is grounded for a short time. Most attacks don't harm grounded targets, but there are some exceptions 
            (e.g. Barbarian's <span class="_x">Shockwave</span>). Whenever you are able to continue damaging a target by picking it up with a ground hitting skill, we're talking 
            about a ground combo.
          </p>

          There are no easy ground combos, but here's a mediocre one:
          <ul>
            <li>Barbarian, do a basic combo (<span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span>), wait until your target 
              hits the ground, use <span class="_x">Shockwave (X)</span> to throw your target into the air, wait until your target is at the perfect height for 
              an air combo, do another basic combo (<span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span>, <span class="_a">(A)</span>)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some enemies use ground hitting skills, too. Luckily, there are two ways to get up faster:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use your Block (RB) skill while being grounded (works immediately after hitting the ground)</li>
            <li>Use your <span class="_a">Attack (A)</span> to perform a <span class="_a">Rise Attack</span> (works after half the grounding time has passed, has endurance)</li>
          </ul>
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="endu_invi">Endurance &amp; Invincibility</h2>
          <p>
            Endurance, ingame often abbreviated as "Endu", is a state where a character can't be flinched or be thrown into the air, but still receives damage dealt. 
            Endurance is visualized by a yellow glowing orb at the charater's location. Bosses have a skill that grants endurance for a long time, but players have 
            some skills that grant endurance, too (e.g. Block or Barbarian's <span class="_y">Whirlwind (Y)</span>).

      <div class="box_row">
        <div class="box_content">
          Invincibility, ingame often abbreviated as "Invi", is the enhancement of endurance. An invicible character ignores all kind of hostile effects and 
          incoming damage. Bosses are invicible while preparing their ultimate skills, but players have some skills that grant invincibility, too (e.g. 
          Knight's <span class="_y">Shield Dash (Y)</span>).
