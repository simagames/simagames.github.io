          <p>
            There are multiple ways to play and enjoy Legends of Pixelia. Some players like challenging combat, some players don't. The focus of this guide is to get 
            through the game (including Game+ Mode) as easy as possible and the guide is directed mostly to new players. The target game version of this guide is 1.03. 
            I tried to avoid spoilers wherever possible.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to our journey through the many dungeons in Legends of Pixelia. To be able to enjoy our trip, we should start with some configurations.
          </p>
          <p><b>Setup: Gamepad</b></p>
          <p>
            If you're using a gamepad, press 'Q' on the title screen to start a gamepad config. Since hardware manufacturers didn't succed in arraging an industry 
            standard for gamepad button mappings, you as a customer have to suffer. I'm sorry for their stupidity.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <img src="barbguide/setup_gamepad.jpeg" alt="Setup Gamepad" width="800" class="img_800">
          <p><b>Setup: Keyboard</b></p>
          <p>
            If you don't want to play with a gamepad, you can use your keyboard instead. In the options menu (main menu -> options), there are two different keyboard input 
            layouts. Choose your prefered one.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <img src="barbguide/setup_keyboard.jpeg" alt="Setup Keyboard" width="800" class="img_800">
          <p><b>Setup: Options</b></p>
          <p>
            Next, in the options menu (main menu -> options) we want to change the difficulty to <span class="_a">Casual</span>. This is important for this guide since 
            we're not seeking challenge here. Also, the game has been developed on a very bright display. With a regular monitor, you want to change the brightness 
            setting to <span class="_y">4</span>. Apply changes and leave the options screen.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <img src="barbguide/setup_options.jpeg" alt="Setup Options" width="800" class="img_800">
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>
          <p>
            Now let's start! Choose <span class="_y">Play Adventure</span> and create a new hero. Since this a barbarian guide, we want to create a barbarian (duh :-D). 
            Give it a nice name (since it is displayed in the leaderboard later on), make sure that <span class="_y">Softcore</span> is selected and hit 
            <span class="_y">Okay</span>. I also created a barbarian while creating this guide. Mine is called Conaan (named after a famous barbarian and a 
            delicious Indian bread).
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <img src="barbguide/gettingstarted_conaan.jpeg" alt="Name Hero" width="800" class="img_800">
          <p>
            You will start in stage 1-1, a small tutorial map. The red question marks can be hit for some helpful info. 
            Before we go on, let's consider some general tips.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="generaltips">General Barbarian Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The Whirlwind skill has endurance frames. While executing Whirlwind, enemy attacks can not flinch you. Use Whirlwind to escape annoying situations (e.g. when cornered, against spider webs or against packs of summoned enemies). You can move while executing Whirlwind, too!</li>
            <li>The Shockwave skill can hit enemies lying on the floor. Use this against normal enemies or bosses.</li>
            <li>Some dead end rooms contain grey angel like statues. Hit those 10 times to get some permanent stat bonuses.</li>
            <li>When finding new items, we always value defense rating changes twice as high as attack rating changes (e.g. we don't take items that increase attack rating by 10 but reduce defense rating by 6, since 10 - 2*6 = -2). This simple rule helps us to survive in the long run.</li>
            <li>When fighting bosses, focus on the normal enemies first.</li>
            <li>When finding epic items (which is very rare on Casual difficulty), we prefer Whirlwind effects (Y-, W-, [8]-) over defensive effects over everything else.</li>
            <li>In the early stages we always want to do <a href="#farmingfullclear">Full Clear [FC]</a> runs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="farmingfullclear">Farming: Full Clear [FC]</h2>
          <p>
            To perform a Full Clear run, abbreviated as [FC] from now on, you simply clear every room of a map before visiting the boss room. 
            The boss room is marked by a red/orange skull icon. When no other room is left to discover, we go to the boss room. This method is mainly used in 
            the early stages to gather some experience points.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="levelups">Stat Point Distribution</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Level 1 to 40: <b><span class="_y">Special</span></b> to boost our Whirlwind skill</li>
            <li>Level 41 to 80: <b>Defensive</b> to help us survive Game+ Mode</li>
            <li>Level 81 to 100: <b>Offensive</b> to ensure well balanced damage for the endgame</li>
          </ul>
          <p> </p>
          <img src="barbguide/leveling.jpeg" alt="Leveling" width="800" class="img_800">
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="dungeon1">Dungeon 1 - The Crypt</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>There are <a href="/games/legends-of-pixelia-assets/bestiary.html#dungeon-1">Spider</a> enemies in the first dungeon that like to annoy melee heroes with their webs. Use your Whirlwind skill to be able to deal damage without being flinchable.</li>
            <li><span class="_y"><b>Stage 1-1</b></span>: As mentioned earlier, 1-1 is a tutorial stage. It should be straight forward. Do a <a href="#farmingfullclear">[FC]</a> and get your first item in the treasure room. Don't forget that we focus on defensive stats when choosing an item.</li>
            <li>After Stage 1-1, we can choose stat points for the first time. Check out the <a href="#levelups">Stat Point Distribution</a> (we choose <b>Special</b> for the first few levels).</li>
            <li><span class="_y"><b>Stage 1-2</b></span>: [FC] again. If you think that the boss is too hard on the first try, choose <b>Restart Stage</b> and do another [FC].</li>
            <li><span class="_y"><b>Stage 1-3</b></span>: [FC]. After beating the endboss of this dungeon, we get 2 big treasure chests and our first leaderboard entry. Woohoo!</li>
            <li>Don't spend gold on upgrades yet.</li>

          <p>
            In the preparation screen, there is an info showing <b>INV. FULL: <span class="_a">0/8</span></b>. If the first number is not 0, go to your 
            inventory and sell spare items before starting a new dungeon. Don't worry, you can't sell your currently equipped items. So if you always equip 
            better items when opening a big treasure chest, you can sell all spare items.

              (Instead of pressing the <span class="_a">Attack</span> button three times, you can also press and hold the button.)</li>
            <li><b>Whirlwind to Attack</b>: <span class="_y">Whirlwind</span>, (wait to the last frame), <span class="_a">Attack</span>, <span class="_a">Attack</span>, <span class="_a">Attack</span></li>

          <p>
            To perform a Boss Run, abbreviated as [BR] from now on, you need to be in the last stage of a dungeon. The dungeon endboss always drops 2 big treasure 
            chests and is easily spottable due to the Skull Compass. Also, boss kills give some nice experience points. The main idea is to go directly to the boss, 
            kill it, loot both big treasure chests (ignoring the coins) and <span class="_y">NOT to exit the dungeon through the portal</span>, but to choose 
            <b>Restart Stage (Prepare)</b> in the pause menu instead. This way, we are able to repeat the endboss fight multiple times in a row. "[BR] to level X" 
            means that you should repeat doing Boss Runs until your hero is level X. Leave the dungeon afterwards.
          </p>
          <p> </p>
          <h2 id="epicitems">Epic Item Drop Chance</h2>
          <p>
            Epic items are super rare. Epic items are super powerful. Epic items can be farmed with a guaranteed drop if you're persistent enough. So, let's have a 
            look at how the epic item drop chance is working in Legends of Pixelia.
          </p>
          <p>
            When entering a dungeon, a stack of 60 cards (in Casual difficulty) is shuffled randomly. 59 out of the 60 cards are "normal item drop" cards, one card 
            is an "epic item drop" card. Every time you open up a big treasure chest, the top card is drawn. This way, the first item per dungeon run has a chance 
            of 1/60 to be epic, the second items has a chance of 1/59 to be epic, etc. So if we're very unlucky, we need to open up 59 big treasure chests with normal 
            items until we find our guaranteed epic item. After finding an epic item, the stack with all 60 cards is shuffled again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The three dice artifacts all increase the epic item chance by removing "normal item drop" cards from the stack; Rigged Dice remove one card, Casino Dice 
            and Devil's Dice remove two cards each. Also, after buying a dice artifact, the stack is shuffled again - don't buy one when you just opened up 20 (or more) 
            normal item big treasure chests!
          </p>
          <p>
            [BR] are the most effective way to farm epic items in Game+ Mode, since you get 2 big treasure chests for each kill. In addition to this, finding the treasure 
            room becomes more and more complicated in Game+ Mode since the dungeon size increases steadily. In Casual difficulty, we need 30 [BR] for a guaranteed epic item.
          </p>
          <p>The chosen difficulty also affects the item drop stack size. Here's a table:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <table class="lop_guide_table">
            <tr>
              <td><b>Difficulty</b></td>
              <td><b>Item Drop Cards</b></td>
              <td><b>/w All Dice Artifacts</b></td>

              <td>Casual</td>

          <p>In my opinion it's easier (and faster) to do 30 [BR] on Casual difficulty than it is to do 15 on Original difficulty.</p>

            <li>The Attack Rating comparison value when finding new items no longer matters to us. We don't want the highest total damage anymore, we want all of our skills to be balanced out damage wise.</li>

            <li>Each of the 4 bosses is only vulnerable against one of your skills. Since you are following this guide, each of your skills is dealing some nice damage. I'd suggest the following order: green, yellow, red, blue. Green is a good starter since your HP should be high (or full) when entering the boss room. The summons of green are vulnerable to all skills. Yellow should be easy with this build, take the chance to heal up after the kill. Red deals some high melee damage. Since our throwing axe is ranged, try to avoid being too close to it. Blue might be tricky. Try to use the Block+Shockwave combo and try to be on a vertical line with it during cooldowns.</li>

            I enjoyed the playthrough and I really hope that you did, too! It was a fun experience and I played carefully enough to beat the game with 0 deaths. ^_^

            The build worked out quite nice and I had some lucky epic item drops but at the end of the day, the Barbarian still isn't my favorite hero in Legends of Pixelia. 
            But maybe it is your favorite hero class now?
